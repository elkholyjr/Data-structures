# Welcome to the Data Structures repository! This repository contains implementations of various fundamental data structures in C++. Each data structure is organized into its own directory with relevant source code files.

## Graphs

The `Graphs` directory includes:

- **AVL_Tree.cpp**: An implementation of the AVL Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree. It is used to maintain sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.
- **BST.cpp**: An implementation of a binary search tree, which is used for maintaining a dynamic set of sorted elements and allows for efficient search operations.

## Linked List

The `Linked_List` directory contains:

- **singleLinked_Class.cpp**: A singly linked list implementation. Linked lists are used for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions/deletions.
- **circularLinkedList.cpp**: An implementation of a circular linked list, where the last node points back to the first node, useful for applications like round-robin scheduling.
- **doubleLinkedList.cpp**: A doubly linked list implementation, allowing traversal in both directions, which is useful for complex data manipulation.

## Stack

The `Stack` directory features:

- **oop.cpp**: A stack implementation using object-oriented programming principles. Stacks are used for managing function calls, undo mechanisms, and more.

## Vector

The `vector` directory is reserved for future implementations related to dynamic arrays, which provide random access and
