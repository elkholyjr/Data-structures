# Welcome to the Data Structures repository! This repository contains implementations of various fundamental data structures in C++. Each data structure is organized into its own directory with relevant source code files.

The `Graphs` directory includes:

- **AVL_Tree.cpp**: An implementation of the AVL Tree, a self-balancing binary search tree. It is used to maintain sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.

## Linked List

The `Linked_List` directory contains:

- **singleLinked_Class.cpp**: A singly linked list implementation. Linked lists are used for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertions/deletions.

## Stack

The `Stack` directory features:

- **oop.cpp**: A stack implementation using object-oriented programming principles. Stacks are used for managing function calls, undo mechanisms, and more.

## Vector

The `vector` directory is reserved for future implementations related to dynamic arrays, which provide random access and efficient resizing.

## Getting Started

To use this repository, clone it to your local machine:
